App-ZofCMS-Plugin-AutoEmptyQueryDelete

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that I made after I got sick and tired of
constantly writing this (where C<$q> is query parameters hashref):

    do_something
        if defined $q->{foo}
            and length $q->{foo};

By simply including this module in the list of plugins to run, I can save a few keystrokes
by writing:

    do_something
        if exists $q->{foo};

This documentation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>, L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

=head1 WHAT DOES THE PLUGIN DO

The plugin doesn't do much, but simply C<delete()>s query parameters that are not defined
or are of zero length if they are. With that being done, we can use a simple C<exists()>
on a key.
